# A cafe website using face recognition

## Inspiration
We all crave for different kind of food in our day-to-day lives based on our emotions. This inspired me to create a platform where we could get a a suggestion like what kind of food we can order to have a change in our moods. 


## What it does?
This JavaScript-based application uses face- recoginition feature as to detect the face patterns using the device's camera and creates a coded pattern around the face. The emotion detector tells the users if their expression is a happy, neutral, sad or surprised one.

Then based on these emotions the website suggests you the type of food you can order to uplift your mood.
